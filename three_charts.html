  <h1>People Killed by the Police Officers in the US in 2015</h1>
  <p>
    I used a line chart to show the number of people killed by the police officers in each days to find out is there a peak day. 
    Looking at ring chart, I can see the share of males and females in the total number of cases. I also used a bar chart to show the distribute
    of the cases in different states.
  </p>
  <p>I counted the number of people killed in each days, genders and each states for graphing.</p>
